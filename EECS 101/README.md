# Introduction to Machine Vision
Hw1 dealt with generating images of perspective and orthographic projections of lines defined by equations. 
Hw2 deals with reading a digital image and estimating certain values. 
Hw3 deals with displaying a gray level image, determining a threshold of the image with a histogram, then generating and displaying a binary image using the threshold.
Hw4 deals with the application of an edge detection algorithm on a gray level image by using the Sobel operator to create an image that is proportional to the squared gradient magnitude of the gray level image, and then generating a binary image using a threshold.
Hw5 deals with detecting straight line edges using Hough transform by reproducing the same steps as hw4, but also estimating edge orientation and then applying a voting array to find linear edges.
Hw7 deals with generating images of a sphere under orthographic projection using a reflectance model.
